# EnderChest Portal
EnderChest Portal for Bukkit  
  
This Plugin comes from memes in a Minecraft parody speedrun record video.  
In my memory, the earliest version of the End Portal frame was crafted from End Stone and Obsidian—it actually had a recipe. When I saw that video where they used an Ender Chest to teleport to the End, it reminded me that the frame normally requires Eyes of Ender. But originally, it was made of Obsidian and End Stone, while the Ender Chest was just a version without End Stone but with an Eye of Ender inside. That’s why, in the video, they opened the Ender Chest and jumped into to get to the End.  
Based on this idea, I designed this plugin to achieve exactly that - when you step on an Ender Chest and then open it, it will teleport you to the End.  
Thanks for liking it! ✨
